# gc_counter

This is an example implementation of a simple bioinformatics workflow:

Count the GC contents of a fasta file and write the results into a bigwig file counting the CG content of the sequence in valiable bin sizes.

This is a tiny project that should introduce the usage of Rust in Bioinformatics to experienced R and Python programmers.

And this repo is the example implementation, not the tutorial on the basics of Rust progamming...

Took me ~ 2h to implement.
